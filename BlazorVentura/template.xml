  <title>Create a Blazor WebAssembly project with an ASP.NET Core Web API middle-tier (.NET 5)</title>
  <description>
    Blazor is a .NET web framework that allows C# code to run cross-platform in the browser.
    The template installs a Blazor WebAssembly client project and an ASP.NET Core server project.
    At runtime a browser automatically downloads the client from the webserver and runs it locally.
    The server's role is both Web server and Web API middle-tier for data access.
    The server connects to a SQLite database for which sample recordsets have been generated.
