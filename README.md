# Templates used by VenturaSQL

When you [Download](https://dotnet.sysdev.nl/venturasql) and run the VenturaSQL installer, the template (sample) C# projects 
are automatically installed.

But when you download and run the source code from the [VenturaSQL GitHub repository](https://github.com/frankthvandeven/VenturaSQL),
the templates dropdown-list in "New Project" window will display a message, saying that templates are not available. 
It also displays the name of the expected folder location:

This is because the VenturaSQL repository on GitHub does not contain the template projects.

You can add the templates manually.

Create the "Templates" folder in the location as displayed in the message.
Then copy the contents of this repository into the Templates folder. 
Re-open the "New Project" window, and the templates should be there.
