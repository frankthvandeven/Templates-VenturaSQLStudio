# Templates used by VenturaSQL

When you [Download](https://dotnet.sysdev.nl/venturasql) and run the VenturaSQL installer, the template (sample) C# projects are automatically installed.

But when you download and run the source code from the GitHub repository, the templates dropdown in "New Project" window will display a message, saying that templates are not available:

This is because the VenturaSQL repository on GitHub does not contain the template projects.

You can add them manually.

Create the "Templates" folder as displayed in the message, and copy the contents of this repository into it. Then re-open the New Project window, and the templates should be there.
